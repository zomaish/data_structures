Both protocols have Source port, Destination port, Check Sum

TCP:                                                    UDP:
1- Connection oriented                                  connectionless
2- Deliver messages                                     Deliver messages
3- HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP, Telnet	                      DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, VOIP
4- TCP rearranges data packets in the                   UDP has no inherent order as all packets are independent of each other.
order specified.	                                      If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.
5- Slower                                               faster
6- Reliable                                             No guarantee
7- Streamed                                             packets sent individually
8- TCP header size is 20 bytes	                        UDP Header size is 8 bytes.
9- TCP is heavy-weight. TCP requires three              No h  andshake
packets to set up a socket connection
10- TCP does error checking and error recovery.         UDP does error checking but simply discards erroneous packets.
Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source     Error recovery is not attempted.
to the destination.
11- Acknowledgement segments	                          No Acknowledgment
