Amazon Route 53 (Route 53) is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS).
It is part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform,
Amazon Web Services (AWS). The name is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53,
where DNS server requests are addressed.
In addition to being able to route users to various AWS services, including EC2 instances,
Route 53 also enables AWS customers to route users to non-AWS infrastructure.

Route 53's servers are distributed throughout the world.
Amazon Route 53 supports full, end-to-end DNS resolution over IPv6.
Recursive DNS resolvers on IPv6 networks can use either IPv4 or IPv6 transport to send DNS queries to Amazon Route 53.


Route 53 started out as an authoritative DNS service for AWS users. They have more recently started introducing features
that allow you to push your traffic between different AWS regions. Today, we want to take a look at how that product stacks up.

Route 53 allows users to set up conditional routing trees that establish rules for when to fail over to your various other
cloud instances in different regions.  These conditional routing trees are dependent on some form of health check that you establish,
as well. Sound like a lot of work? It is.
