Often figuring out how to combine solutions helps lead to correct subproblem definitions. There
are a few major ways to combine solutions
Prefix/Suffix - Start with solving smaller subproblems from beginning (or end) and expand
subproblems towards the end (or the beginning). Examples: Assembly line, Crazy 8’s, Piano
fingering

Substring - Start with solving smaller subproblems substrings and expand outwards. We need
to use this in problems where we can’t take advantage of prefix/suffix structures. Examples: Multiplication
parentheses, Two person coin game (Consider a row of n coins of values v(1) ... v(n),
where n is even. We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player
selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives
the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if
we move first.)

Combination - If you’re storing solutions in some multi-dimensional table, you often combine
solutions from other cells. The order may be a combination of prefix/suffix/substring with each
dimension of the table using a different structure. Examples: DNA alignment, Edit distance
Tree - Start with solving smaller subproblems at the leaves and expand upwards, level by level,
until you solve the the subproblem at the root. Examples: Phylogeny, Vertex cover in tree, railroad
gauge
